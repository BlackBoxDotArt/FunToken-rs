# FunToken-rs

Based on Mintable Fungible Token for Rainbow Bridge: https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge-rs/tree/master/mintable-fungible-token

This contract will implement $NMT (Near $MENTA) the token of Hackumenta - A full Art Fair organized peer to peer and funded through a token sale.

Every interaction with $MENTA (mint, burn, transfer) will microfund the Hackumenta Pool for the Art Fair. 

Proceeds are completely dedicated to fund the Fair effectively acting as an “Art Pre Sale” - or more cheekly an Initial Art Offering.

The goal of this token is to mirror the economics of TrojanToken.sol and mirror $MENTA across the Rainbow Bridge so that participants cantake advantage of the lower costs and faster speeds of the Near blockchain. 

This Fungible Token is the foundation stone upon which real life art experiences are built.
